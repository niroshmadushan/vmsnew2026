---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before (Shared Component)
```
Admin Bookings Page
      ↓
Uses: BookingManagement ←┐
                         ├─ SHARED
Employee Bookings Page   │
      ↓                  │
Uses: BookingManagement ←┘
```

**Problem:** Shared component meant changes affected both!

### After (Separate Components) ✅
```
Admin Bookings Page
      ↓
Uses: BookingManagement (admin version)

Employee Bookings Page
      ↓
Uses: EmployeeBookingManagement (employee version) ⭐
```

**Solution:** Independent components - each can be customized!
