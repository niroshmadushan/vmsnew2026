## 🚀 How It Works

### Architecture

```
Employee Dashboard
      ↓
Click "All Bookings"
      ↓
/employee/bookings page
      ↓
BookingManagement component
      ↓
Same component admin uses!
      ↓

```

### Code Flow

```javascript
// app/employee/bookings/page.tsx
export default function EmployeeBookingsPage() {
  return (
    <EmployeeSidebar /> +
    <DashboardLayout> +

  )
}
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Frontend (Implemented)
✅ Route protected with `requireAuth(["employee"])`  
✅ Role-based navigation (only shows to employees)  
✅ Component reuse (same security as admin)  

### Backend (Recommended to Implement)

**Should add backend checks for:**

```javascript
// Recommended backend permission logic
export async function updateBooking(bookingId, data, user) {
  const booking = await getBooking(bookingId)
  
  // Allow admin to edit any booking
  if (user.role === 'admin') {
    return updateBookingInDB(bookingId, data)
  }
  
  // Allow employee to edit only their own bookings
  if (user.role === 'employee' && booking.created_by === user.id) {
    return updateBookingInDB(bookingId, data)
  }
  
  // Otherwise, deny
  return { error: "You can only edit your own bookings" }
}
```

**Recommended Permissions:**

| Action | Admin | Employee (Own Booking) | Employee (Others' Booking) |
|--------|-------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| View | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All (read-only) |
| Create | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| Edit | ✅ All | ✅ Own | ❌ Deny |
| Delete | ✅ All | ✅ Own | ❌ Deny |
